My solutions in C++ for Project Euler problems

To run any solution just include the appropriate header file and then call solution<ProblemNumber>()

e.g. #include "SolutionSixteen.h" ... cout << solutionSixteen(); ...

Include "TestAnswers.h" and run testAnswers() to run each solution and verify it's answer

GenericFunctions.cpp does not contains solutions, but functions which are useful for many solutions, so are kept accessible to them all to avoid rewriting them

Include "GenericFunctions.h" to run any of them individually
